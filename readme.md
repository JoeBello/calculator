# MacOS Calculator

#### A JavaScript calculator based on the appearance and functionality of the native MacOS calculator.


The main goal for this project was to replicate the look and feel of the
native MacOS calculator. Equally as important was to maintain a manageable
codebase that embraced a clear separation of concerns, and encouraged individual components to manage their own state while presenting an API for other components to interact with.
